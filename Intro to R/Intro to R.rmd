# Introduction

Learning Objectives

- Describe R and RStudio.

- Interact with R using RStudio.

- Use the various features of RStudio.

- Learn basic R operation.

- Generate the same RMarkdown report in HTML format. 

## What is R?

The common misconception is that R is a programming language but in fact it is much more than that. Let's think of R as an environment for statistical computing and graphics, which brings together a number of features to provide powerful functionality.

The R environment combines:

- effective handling of big data

- collection of integrated tools

- graphical facilities

- simple and effective programming language

## Why use R?

![](./image/why_R.png)

R is a powerful, extensible environment. It has a wide range of statistics and general data analysis and visualization capabilities.

- Data handling, wrangling, and storage

- Wide array of statistical methods and graphical techniques available

- Easy to install on any platform and use (and it’s free!)

- Open source with a large and growing community of peers


## What is RStudio?

RStudio is freely available open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.

- Graphical user interface, not just a command prompt

- Great learning tool

- Free for academic use

- Platform agnostic

- Open source


## RStudio Interface

The RStudio interface has four main panels:

- Console: where you can type commands and see output. The console is all you would see if you ran R in the command line without RStudio.

- Script editor: where you can type out commands and save to file. You can also submit the commands to run in the console.

- Environment/History: environment shows all active objects and history keeps track of all commands run in console

- Files/Plots/Packages/Help



# Assignment operator

Variables are assigned usually using the <- operator. The = operator also works in a similar way for most part.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Hide all warnings and messages, show code
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

```{r}

x <- 4
x = 4
x

```

# Arithmetic operators

The commonly used arithmetic operators are shown below returning a number.

```{r}

x <- 4
y <- 2

# add
x + y

# subtract
x - y

# multiply
x * y

# divide
x / y

# modulus
x %% y

# power
x ^ y

```

# Logical operators

Logical operators return a logical TRUE or FALSE.

```{r}

# equal to?
x == y

# not equal to?
x != y

# greater than?
x > y

# less than?
x < y

# greater than or equal to?
x >= y

# less than or equal to?
x <= y

```

# Data types

```{r}

class(1)
class("hello")
class(T)


```

```{r}

x <- c(2,3,4,5,6)
y <- c("a","c","d","e")
z <- factor(c("a","c","d","e"))
class(z)

```

```{r}

x <- matrix(c(2,3,4,5,6,7),nrow=3,ncol=2)
class(x)
str(x)

```

```{r}

dfr <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
print(dfr)

```

```{r}

class(dfr)

```

```{r}

str(dfr)

```

# Accessors

Vectors positions can be accessed using []. R follows 1-based indexing.

```{r}

x <- c(2,3,4,5,6)
x
x[2]

```

Dataframe or matrix positions can be accessed using [] specifying row and column like [row,column].

```{r}

dfr <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
dfr
dfr[1,]
dfr[,1]
dfr[2,2]

```

# Functions

```{r}

# generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 200
x <- sample(x=1:200,10)
x

# length
length(x)

# sum
sum(x)

# mean
mean(x)

# median
median(x)

# min
min(x)

# log
log(x)

# exponent
exp(x)

# square-root
sqrt(x)

# round
round(x)

# sort
sort(x)

```

Some useful string functions.

```{r}

a <- "sunny"
b <- "day"

# join
paste(a, b)

# find a pattern
grep("sun", a)

# number of characters
nchar("sunny")

# to uppercase
toupper("sunny")

# to lowercase
tolower("SUNNY")

# replace pattern
sub("sun", "fun", "sunny")

# substring
substr("sunny", start=1, stop=3)

```

Some general functions

```{r}

print("hello")
print("world")
cat("hello")
cat(" world")
cat("\nhello\nworld")

```

# Merging

Two strings can be joined together using paste().

```{r}

a <- "sunny"
b <- "day"

paste(a, b)
paste(a, b, sep="-")

```

The function c() is used to concatenate objects.

```{r}

a <- "sunny"
b <- "day"

c(a,b)

```

The function cbind() is used to join two dataframes column-wise.

```{r}

dfr1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
dfr2 <- data.frame(p = 4:6, q = c("d", "e", "f"))
dfr1
dfr2

cbind(dfr1,dfr2)

```

Similarily, rbind() is used to join two dataframes row-wise.

```{r}

dfr1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
dfr2 <- data.frame(x = 4:6, y = c("d", "e", "f"))
dfr1
dfr2

rbind(dfr1,dfr2)

```

Two dataframes can be merged based on a shared column using the merge() function.

```{r}

dfr1 <- data.frame(x = 1:4, p = c("a", "b", "c","d"))
dfr2 <- data.frame(x = 3:6, q = c("l", "m", "n","o"))
dfr1
dfr2

merge(dfr1,dfr2,by="x")
merge(dfr1,dfr2,by="x",all.x=T)
merge(dfr1,dfr2,by="x",all.y=T)
merge(dfr1,dfr2,by="x",all=T)

```

# Read and write files

ead comma separated file (csv) using read.csv function:

> table1 <- read.csv("example_table.csv")

Set the first column as the row names:

> table1 <- read.csv("example_table.csv", row.names = 1)

Or use the more general read.table function and specify the separater:

> table1 <- read.table("example_table.csv", sep = ",")

We will need to set the row names and column names manually:

> table1 <- read.table("example_table.csv", sep = ",", row.names = 1, header = T)

Write the variable to csv format using write.csv function:

> write.csv(table1, "example_table1.csv")

# Packages

## CRAN

The Comprehensive R Archive Network CRAN is the biggest archive of R packages. There are few requirements for uploading packages besides building and installing succesfully, hence documentation and support is often minimal and figuring how to use these packages can be a challenge it itself. CRAN is the default repository R will search to find packages to install:

> install.packages("YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME")

```{r, eval=F}

install.packages("devtools")

# or multiple packages

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "stringr"))

```

## BioConductor

Bioconductor is a repository of R-packages specifically for biological analyses. It has the strictest requirements for submission, including installation on every platform and full documentation with a tutorial (called a vignette) explaining how the package should be used. Bioconductor also encourages utilization of standard data structures/classes and coding style/naming conventions, so that, in theory, packages and analyses can be combined into large pipelines or workflows.

Bioconductor also requires creators to support their packages and has a regular 6-month release schedule. Make sure you are using the most recent release of bioconductor before trying to install packages for the course.


```{r, eval=F}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("PACKAGE_NAME", ask = FALSE)

```

## GitHub

GitHub isn’t specific to R, any code of any type in any state can be uploaded. There is no guarantee a package uploaded to github will even install, nevermind do what it claims to do. R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from github using the “devtools” package installed above.

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("username/repository")

```


# Graphics

## Base

R is an excellent tool for creating graphs and plots. The graphic capabilities and functions provided by the base R installation is called the base R graphics. Numerous packages exist to extend the functionality of base graphics.

We can try out plotting a few of the common plot types. Let’s start with a scatterplot. First we create a data.frame as this is the most commonly used data object.

```{r}

dfr <- data.frame(a=sample(1:100,10),b=sample(1:100,10))

```

Now we have a dataframe with two continuous variables that can be plotted against each other.

```{r}

plot(dfr$a,dfr$b)

```

This is probably the simplest and most basic plots. We can modify the x and y axis labels.

```{r}

plot(dfr$a,dfr$b,xlab="Variable a",ylab="Variable b")

```

We can change the point to a line.

```{r}

plot(dfr$a,dfr$b,xlab="Variable a",ylab="Variable b",type="b")

```

Let’s add a categorical column to our dataframe.

```{r}

dfr$cat <- rep(c("C1","C2"),each=5)

```

And then colour the points by category.

```{r}

# subset data
dfr_c1 <- subset(dfr,dfr$cat == "C1")
dfr_c2 <- subset(dfr,dfr$cat == "C2")

plot(dfr_c1$a,dfr_c1$b,xlab="Variable a",ylab="Variable b",col="red",pch=1)
points(dfr_c2$a,dfr_c2$b,col="blue",pch=2)

legend(x="topright",legend=c("C1","C2"),
       col=c("red","blue"),pch=c(1,2))

```

Let’s create a barplot.

```{r}

ldr <- data.frame(a=letters[1:10],b=sample(1:50,10))
barplot(ldr$b,names.arg=ldr$a)

```


## Grid

Grid graphics have a completely different underlying framework compared to base graphics. Generally, base graphics and grid graphics cannot be plotted together. The most popular grid-graphics based plotting library is ggplot2.

Let’s create the same plot are before using ggplot2. Make sure you have the package installed.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dfr,aes(x=a,y=b,colour=cat))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Variable a",y="Variable b")

```

It is generally easier and more consistent to create plots using the ggplot2 package compared to the base graphics.

Let’s create a barplot as well.

```{r}

ggplot(ldr,aes(x=a,y=b))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")

```

# Input/Output

Input and output of data and images is an important aspect with data analysis.

## Text

Data can come in a variety of formats which needs to be read into R and converted to an R data type.

Text files are the most commonly used input. Text files can be read in using the function read.table. We have a sample file to use: iris.txt.

```{r}

#dfr <- read.table("iris.txt",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

```

This reads in a tab-delimited text file with a header. The argument sep='\t' is set by default to specify that the delimiter is a tab. stringsAsFactors=F setting ensures that character columns are not automatically converted to factors.

It’s always a good idea to check the data after import.

```{r}

head(dfr)

```

```{r}

str(dfr)

```

Check ?read.table for other wrapper functions to read in text files.

Let’s filter this data.frame and create a new dataset.

```{r}

dfr1 <- dfr[dfr$Species == "setosa",]

```

And we can write this as a text file.

```{r}

write.table(dfr1,"iris-setosa.txt",sep="\t",row.names=F,quote=F)

```

sep="\t" sets the delimiter to tab. row.names=F denotes that rownames should not be written. quote=F specifies that doubles must not be placed around strings.

## Base graphics

The general idea for saving plots is open a graphics device, create the plot and then close the device. We will use png here. Check out ?png for the arguments and other devices.

```{r}

dfr <- data.frame(a=sample(1:100,10),b=sample(1:100,10))

png(filename="plot-base.png")
plot(dfr$a,dfr$b)
dev.off()

```

## ggplot2

The same idea can be applied to ggplot2, but in a slightly different way. First save the file to a variable, and then export the plot.

```{r}

p <- ggplot(dfr,aes(a,b)) + geom_point()

png(filename="plot-ggplot-1.png")
print(p)
dev.off()

```

ggplot2 also has another easier helper function to export images.

```{r}

ggsave(filename="plot-ggplot-2.png",plot=p)

```

# Build a report in HTML format 

RStudio includes a "Knit" button that enables you to render an .Rmd and preview it using a single click or keyboard shortcut

Click File -> Knit document

# Session Infomation

To improve reproducibility, we usually print out the session information, which contains all loaded packages and versions. 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
